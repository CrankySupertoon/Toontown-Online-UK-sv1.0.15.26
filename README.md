# Toontown-Online-UK-sv1.0.15.26
The Installation and game code (decompiled) for Toontown online sv1.0.15.26



# Backstory
I was looking on Ebay UK for anything Toontown Online related, as I find the past of the game quite interesting. I happened to come accross a Toontown installation CD for the UK server. I've worked for the past few hours to dump the code and decompile it. It also included a few images of the game, and the UK trialer, I have also included a copy of the installation disk itself.

I hope you all can find this as interesting as I do and maybe somebody can put this to good use!
